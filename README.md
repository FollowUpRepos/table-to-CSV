# Barebones React App #

This repo contains the very simplest set of files to get started with a React project.

**If you clone this repository, you must run `npm install` (or `npm i`) in order to download all the node modules that are listed in `package.json`.**

You can then keep this directory exactly as it is, in a safe place, and make a duplicate of it every time you want to start a new React project.

In your duplicated directory, you will probably want to change:

1. The `name` entry in `package.json`
2. The text of the `<title>` tag in `public/index.html`
3. The default CSS in `src/index.css`
4. The contents of the `src/App.jsx` file

You can create new files for additional components inside the `src/components/` directory, and import them into the `App.jsx` file to be rendered.

To preview your React app in your default browser, run `npm start`.
